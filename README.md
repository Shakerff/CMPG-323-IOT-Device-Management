# What We Are Required To Do

To test our understanding of Standards & Patterns, we will be given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need
to be enhanced and improved. We are expected to grasp architectural patterns as well as execute coding principles and design patterns carefully and in accordance with the project's specifications as part of this project. 

# Types Of Design Patterns and Their Functionality

## Creational 
* These patterns were created for the instantiation of classes. They can be patterns for creating classes or patterns for creating objects.

## Structural
* These designs were created with an eye on the composition and structure of a class. Most of these patterns aim to improve the functionality of the class(es) in         question without significantly altering its makeup.

## Behavioral
* These patterns are created based on how one class interacts with other classes.

# Benefits of Design Pattern

* Saves time - If we apply design patterns wisely, we may save time since they are previously specified and offer an industry standard way to solving a recurrent problem.
* Reusability and Robustness - Utilizing design patterns encourages reusability, which results in code that is more reliable and more maintained. It aids in lowering the software product's total cost of ownership (TCO).
* Easy to understand and easy to debug - Our code is simple to comprehend and debug since design patterns have already been established. It promotes quicker growth and makes it simple for new team members to comprehend.
* Abstraction is maintained - Since the code will be well-maintained and organized, a high degree of abstraction is anticipated.
* Extensible - Massive code will be modularized and simple to extend. One might successfully realize elasticity. Utilizing the right design patterns makes it simple to write and add new code.

# How Will The Project Work

We will work on an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application and we need to implement our own methods such as delete, update, create that will work on each controllerm separately. When we run the app, we must be able to implement changes on the database without any errors. The Web App will use database that is stored on cloud as this will allow only permitted personel to conduct any changes on the databse.
