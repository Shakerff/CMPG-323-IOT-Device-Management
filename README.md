# What We Are Required To Do

To test our understanding of Standards & Patterns, we will be given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need
to be enhanced and improved. We are expected to grasp architectural patterns as well as execute coding principles and design patterns carefully and in accordance with the project's specifications as part of this project. 

# Types Of Design Patterns and Their Functionality

## Creational 
* These patterns were created for the instantiation of classes. They can be patterns for creating classes or patterns for creating objects.

## Structural
* These designs were created with an eye on the composition and structure of a class. Most of these patterns aim to improve the functionality of the class(es) in         question without significantly altering its makeup.

## Behavioral
* These patterns are created based on how one class interacts with other classes.
